# Autobahn Turbo Maniac

## Description

Autobahn Turbo Maniac is my first app as a developer using **Javascript**, **P5.js**, **HTML5**, and **CSS**. To create this title, I got my inspiration from 2D games from the 1990s. The game's purpose is pretty straightforward: The player drives on a highway and has to avoid the randomly generated traffic. The player wins if the timer gets to 0 seconds while hitting one of the other cars will make you lose the game.

## How to play

To play the game the first time, just press on the **START** button. Use the **LEFT** and **RIGHT ARROWS** to avoid the obstacles. If you want to play again, click on RESET first and then START.
